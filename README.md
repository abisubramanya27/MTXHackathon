# MTXHackathon
Code for the Application submitted to MTX Hack Olympics 2.0, 2022.

## Requirements
The server code was built using flask framework in Python-3.7 and the client code was developed in React-17.0.2
But the application is Dockerized, hence there is absolutely no need to worry about different versions of the languages and packages.

## Setup
- Clone this repository
- From the root directory of this repository, run:
```bash
docker-compose up [--detach]
```
( `--detach` if you want the container to run in the background without blocking the shell )
